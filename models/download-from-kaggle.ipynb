Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:\n","\n","The summarize function takes a single argument text which represents the input text to be summarized.\n","The tokenizer function is called to encode the text input. The max_length parameter specifies the maximum length of the input sequence to be generated by the tokenizer. The padding parameter specifies whether to pad the input sequence to the maximum length. The truncation parameter specifies whether to truncate the input sequence if it exceeds the maximum length. The return_attention_mask parameter specifies whether to return the attention mask tensor along with the input tensor. The add_special_tokens parameter specifies whether to add special tokens to the input sequence. The return_tensors parameter specifies the format of the returned tensor, in this case, PyTorch tensor.\n","The generate method of the pre-trained T5 Transformer model is called to generate a summary of the input text. The input_ids parameter specifies the token IDs of the input sequence. The attention_mask parameter specifies the attention mask tensor of the input sequence. The max_length parameter specifies the maximum length of the summary to be generated. The num_beams parameter specifies the number of beams to use in beam search. The repetition_penalty parameter specifies the penalty to apply to repeated tokens in the generated summary. The length_penalty parameter specifies the penalty to apply to the length of the generated summary. The early_stopping parameter specifies whether to stop generating the summary as soon as all beam hypotheses reach the end of the sequence or not.\n","The decode method of the tokenizer is called to convert the generated token IDs to text format. The skip_special_tokens parameter specifies whether to skip special tokens in the generated text. The clean_up_tokenization_spaces parameter specifies whether to remove leading and trailing white spaces from the generated text.\n","The generated text is joined using the join method of the string object and returned as the output of the summarize function.\n","Overall, this code uses the pre-trained T5 Transformer model and tokenizer to generate a summary of the input text. The generate method of the model is used to generate the summary, and the decode method of the tokenizer is used to convert the generated token IDs to text format. The summarize function provides an easy-to-use API for summarizing text using a pre-trained T5 Transformer model."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-27T19:44:15.433784Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-27T19:44:15.433092Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-27T19:44:23.000207Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-27T19:44:22.999145Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-27T19:44:15.433736Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["sample_row = test_df.iloc[3]\n","text = sample_row[\"text\"]\n","model_summary = summarize(text)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-27T19:44:23.002540Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-27T19:44:23.002093Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-27T19:44:23.009513Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-27T19:44:23.008361Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-27T19:44:23.002495Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["text"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-27T19:44:23.018887Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-27T19:44:23.018611Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-27T19:44:23.026557Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-27T19:44:23.025385Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-27T19:44:23.018861Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["sample_row[\"summary\"]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-27T19:44:23.028852Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-27T19:44:23.028165Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-27T19:44:23.038488Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-27T19:44:23.037369Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-27T19:44:23.028804Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["model_summary"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.6"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
